# Learning Structure-Semantic  Evolution Trajectories for Graph Domain Adaptation
This repo is for source code of 2026 ICLR paper "Learning Structure-Semantic  Evolution Trajectories for Graph Domain Adaptation".

# Abstract

Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) aims to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from well-labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs.
Existing methods for UGDA can be broadly categorized into model-oriented and data-oriented approaches. Model-oriented methods typically rely on a unified parameter framework to align domain-invariant representations, but this limits their effectiveness under large structural shifts. Data-oriented methods, on the other hand, model graph transfer as a discrete process by constructing intermediate graphs or alignment steps.
However, this discretization often fails in real-world scenarios, where graph structures evolve continuously and nonlinearly, making it difficult for fixed-step alignment to approximate the actual transformation process.
To address these limitations, we propose DCT, a diffusion-based UGDA method that models cross-graph adaptation as a continuous-time generative process. We formulate the evolution from source to target graphs using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), enabling the joint modeling of structural and semantic transitions. To guide this evolution, we introduce a domain-aware guidance network that estimates the density ratio between source and target graphs in a shared structure–semantic space.  Extensive experiments across 14 transfer tasks demonstrate that DCT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

# Dataset
* **Airport**: It has 3 different domains, i.e., Brazil, Euroup and USA. They can be
  downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zlluWoeukD33ZxwaTRQi3jCdD0qC-I2j?usp=share_link). The graph
  processing can be found at ``AirportDataset``. We utilize ``OneHotDegree`` to construct node features for each node.
* **Blog**: It has 2 different domains, i.e., Blog1 and Blog2. They can be
  downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jKKG0o7rEY-BaVEjBhuGijzwwhU0M-pQ?usp=share_link). The graph
  processing can be found at ``BlogDataset``.
* **Citation**: It has 3 different domains, i.e., ACMv9 , Citationv1 and DBLPv7. They can be
  downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ntNt3qHE4p9Us8Re9tZDaB-tdtqwV8AX?usp=share_link). The graph
  processing can be found at ``CitationDataset``.

# Training: How to run the code

```python
python train.py --source <source dataset> --target <target dataset> --config <config filename>
```

By default, the model uses MMD alignment with dropout 0.2. Important options can be specified
explicitly:

```bash
python train.py \
  --source BRAZIL \
  --target EUROPE \
  --config BRAZIL \
  --alignment mmd \
  --dropout 0.2 \
  --lr 0.001 \
  --eta 0.1 \
  --alpha 0.1 \
  --epoch 150 \
  --diffusion-steps 100
```

# Hyperparameter Search

`search_diffgda.py` runs the hyperparameter grid
`lr={0.0001,0.001,0.01}`, `alpha={0.1,0.2,0.3}`, `eta={0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5}`,
and `T={20,40,60,80,100}` by default. It records final and best target-domain
Micro-F1/Macro-F1 values.

Single-GPU search:

```bash
python search_diffgda.py \
  --scenarios BRAZIL:EUROPE \
  --device cuda:0 \
  --out-dir logs_search/brazil_to_europe \
  --rounds 1 \
  --resume-key default
```

Multi-GPU sharded search:

```bash
SCENARIOS="BRAZIL:EUROPE" GPUS="0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7" bash scripts/run_search.sh
```

Run all directed transfers within one domain:

```bash
DOMAIN=airport GPUS="0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7" bash scripts/run_search.sh
```

Run all 14 transfer tasks:

```bash
ALL_SCENARIOS=1 GPUS="0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7" bash scripts/run_search.sh
```

Use `RESUME_KEY` to separate incompatible search versions:

```bash
RESUME_KEY=airport_mmd_v1 DOMAIN=airport bash scripts/run_search.sh
```

# Evaluate

The `eval_micro_f1` method from the `pygda` library can easily be used to evaluate the performance of the model.

```python
logits, labels = model.predict(target_data)
preds = logits.argmax(dim=1)
mi_f1 = eval_micro_f1(labels, preds)
ma_f1 = eval_macro_f1(labels, preds)
print('micro-f1: ' + str(mi_f1))
print('macro-f1: ' + str(ma_f1))
```
